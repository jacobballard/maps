    <h1>MAPS</h1>
    <p>One mistake Cairo talks about is the inability of a map to accurately represent an area.  The Earth is obviously not a flat
    surface like a map appears to be, a lot of data is lost in making it like this.  This is because of projection, the image distorts when trying to put it as a picture.</p>
    <p>Another mistake has to do with properly representing size.  Cairo says that the sizes of circles representing different quantities could be off if you are not careful
      choosing a size.  This mistake is commonly made by doubling the diameter of a circle rather than its area.</p>
