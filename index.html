    <h1>MAPS</h1>
    <p>One mistake Cairo talks about is the inability of a map to accurately represent an area.  The Earth is obviously not a flat
    surface like a map appears to be, a lot of data is lost in making it like this.  Some of this data could be interpreted if
    the math was topgraphic.</p>
    <p>Another mistake has to do with properly representing size.  Cairo says that population's associated with circles on a map
      could not be accurate.  Incorporating a heat map of population density could be a cool way of showing population accurately.
